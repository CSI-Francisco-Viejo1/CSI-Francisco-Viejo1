            Kanye West is my favorite artist of all time. He is the creator of one of the best hip hop albums of all time,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTH1VNHLjng&list=PL8YH4mOwWryUMna911yJM2B52iIIzigKy">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</a>. Kanye is considered of of the hiphop "GOATS", from his very good lyricism, amazing production, to the ideas and meaning behind his music. Kanye also has one of the most complete and perfect discographies in music history. The new generation of hiphop artists are all heavily influenced by kanye and you can see the reflection of their sound on them.

            Kanye has one of the best set of albums of all time, from the topcharting albums from the "College" trilogy like Late Registration, College Dropout, and Graduation. And collaboration tapes with artists like Kid Cudi on "Kids See Ghosts" and Jay-Z on Watch The Throne, Kanye has earned his respect to having an amazing set of enjoyable a replayable albums. My personal favorite album, "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was recorded in a isolated house in hawaii with him and his manager and 2 friends to help them concentrate on making one of the best albums of all time. This album was created after being rejected by society after degrading Taylor Swifts Grammy award live, and to make a good comeback from this terrible tragedy he had do imprese his audience, which he did. His most recent album "Donda" was dedicated to his recently passed mother named Donda, which was one of the main factors of the start of his depression

            Because of Ye's bipolar disorder he has created many controvercies and has been cancelled by society many times. Some of Kanyes most popular and  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtBs-bUUJJM">controversial</a> were: steeling the microphone from Taylor SWift at the Grammys, announcing his precidential campaign, and legally changing his name to Ye.
